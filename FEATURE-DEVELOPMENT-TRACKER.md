---

## 🎯 Current Development Focus

**Active Development:** Workflow Triggers System - Week 1 Infrastructure (Day 5 - Dependency Triggers)
**Progress:** Days 1-4 complete (Database + Services + API + Prefect Integration)

---

## 📋 Feature Backlog (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Expand Existing Workflows (Non-Breaking Changes)

#### 1. 🎯 Workflow Triggers System
**Status:** 🟢 In Development (Week 1, Day 4 Complete)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 2.5-3 weeks (Started: 2025-01-16)
**Integration Strategy:** Expand workflows from "manual only" to comprehensive trigger system

**Trigger Types Implemented:**
- ✅ **Manual** - User-initiated (already exists)
- 🆕 **Time-based** - Cron scheduling (new)
- 🆕 **Dependency-based** - Run after workflow completion (new)
- 🔮 **Event-driven** - Webhooks, file arrival (Phase 3)

**Architecture Integration:**
- Workflow Detail Page → Add "Triggers" tab (not "Schedule" - future-proof naming)
- Database Schema → New `workflow_triggers` table (supports multiple triggers per workflow)
- Executions Table → Add `trigger_id` and `trigger_type` fields
- Workflows List → Add "Next Run" column for scheduled triggers
- Prefect Integration → Deployment manager + execution completion listener

**Key Design Decisions (2025-01-16):**
- ✅ **Multiple Triggers Per Workflow:** A workflow can have BOTH scheduled AND dependency triggers
- ✅ **Triggers Tab Name:** Use "Triggers" (not "Schedule") for future extensibility
- ✅ **Dependency Conditions:** Support all three (on_success, on_failure, on_completion)
- ✅ **Circular Dependencies:** PREVENT at creation time (industry standard from Airflow/Prefect/Dagster)
- ✅ **Delay Support:** Support delay (default 0 minutes) for eventual consistency windows

**Why First:**
- ✅ Non-breaking addition to existing workflows
- ✅ Leverages existing Prefect integration
- ✅ Makes current file-based workflows production-ready
- ✅ Enables workflow orchestration patterns (DAG dependencies)
- ✅ Clean UI additions without disrupting existing flows

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/workflows/:id/triggers                      # List all triggers
POST   /api/workflows/:id/triggers                      # Create trigger
PUT    /api/workflows/:id/triggers/:triggerId           # Update trigger
DELETE /api/workflows/:id/triggers/:triggerId           # Delete trigger
PATCH  /api/workflows/:id/triggers/:triggerId/enable    # Enable trigger
PATCH  /api/workflows/:id/triggers/:triggerId/disable   # Disable trigger
GET    /api/workflows/:id/triggers/schedule/preview     # Preview next N runs
GET    /api/workflows/:id/triggers/dependencies         # Get dependency graph
GET    /api/workflows/available-upstream                # List available upstream workflows
POST   /api/workflows/:id/triggers/validate-dependency  # Check for circular dependencies
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_triggers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  workflow_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES workflows(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  trigger_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'manual', 'scheduled', 'dependency', 'event'
  enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  trigger_name TEXT,

  -- For scheduled triggers
  cron_expression TEXT,
  timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC',
  next_run_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_run_at TIMESTAMP,

  -- For dependency triggers
  depends_on_workflow_id INTEGER REFERENCES workflows(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  dependency_condition TEXT, -- 'on_success', 'on_failure', 'on_completion'
  delay_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- 0-60 minutes

  -- For event triggers (future)
  event_type TEXT,
  event_config TEXT, -- JSON

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

ALTER TABLE executions ADD COLUMN trigger_id INTEGER REFERENCES workflow_triggers(id);
ALTER TABLE executions ADD COLUMN trigger_type TEXT DEFAULT 'manual';
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- ✅ Circular dependencies prevented at creation time
- ✅ Multiple dependent workflows execute in parallel
- ✅ Deleted upstream workflow cascades to remove dependent triggers
- ✅ Long-running upstream workflows don't timeout dependents
- ✅ Failed upstream workflows respect condition (on_success vs on_completion)
- ✅ Delay windows support eventual consistency (0-60 minutes)

## 🧠 Design Principles Established

### Principle 1: "Expand, Don't Replace"
**From Discussion:** Any new feature should be integrated into existing functionality, expanding capabilities rather than replacing them.

**Example:**
- Scheduler EXPANDS workflows (manual OR scheduled)
- Quality Rules EXPANDS Silver layer (deduplication + validation)
- Database Connectors EXPANDS job sources (files OR databases)

### Principle 2: "Non-Breaking First"
**From Discussion:** Prioritize features that enhance existing functionality without requiring architectural changes.

**Order:**
1. Features that add new tabs/columns (Scheduler, Quality, Alerts)
2. Features that require modal redesigns (Database Connectors)

### Principle 3: "Leverage Existing Infrastructure"
**From Discussion:** Build on top of what's already working.

**Examples:**
- Scheduler uses existing Prefect integration
- Quality Rules uses existing `dq_rules` table and Quality tab
- Alerts uses existing execution event system

---

## 📝 Brainstorming Notes

### Session 1: 2025-01-16 - Scheduler vs Database Connectors

**Key Insight:** Database Connectors require cascading changes:
- Job Creation Modal redesign (source type selector)
- Bronze layer abstraction (file reading → data reading)
- Pattern matching extension (file patterns → table patterns)
- UI updates throughout (source type indicators)

**Decision:** Start with Scheduler (non-breaking, 2 weeks, production-ready)

**Next Steps:**
1. Create feature development plan for Scheduler
2. Design Schedule tab UI
3. Plan database schema updates

---

### Session 2: 2025-01-16 - Expanding Scheduler to Triggers System

**User Insight:** "One thing I want you to keep in mind is any new feature we add, we should also think of how it can be integrated into the existing functionality of FlowForge."

**Key Discussion Points:**
- User requested dependency-based triggers: "Run Workflow B after Workflow A completes"
- This expands the concept from "Scheduling" to "Triggers System"
- Recognized that a workflow might have MULTIPLE triggers (scheduled AND dependency)

**Architectural Decision: Triggers Tab (Not Schedule Tab)**
- **Why:** Future-proof naming supports multiple trigger types
- **Rationale:** A workflow can have time-based, dependency-based, AND event-driven triggers
- **Industry Pattern:** Matches Airflow (triggers), Prefect (automations), Dagster (sensors)

**Multiple Triggers Per Workflow:**
- User confirmed: YES - A workflow should support BOTH scheduled AND dependency triggers
- Example use case: "Run daily at 2 AM AND run after Customer Ingestion completes"

**Dependency Conditions:**
- Implementing all three: on_success, on_failure, on_completion
- Covers use cases: normal flow (on_success), cleanup workflows (on_failure), audit trails (on_completion)

**Circular Dependency Prevention:**
- Following industry standards (Airflow/Prefect/Dagster)
- BLOCK circular dependencies at trigger creation time
- Provide clear error message with dependency chain visualization

**Delay Support:**
- Following industry standards (Airflow wait_for_downstream, Prefect wait_for)
- Support 0-60 minute delays (default: 0 - immediate execution)
- Use case: Eventual consistency windows, downstream system cool-down periods

**Next Steps:**
1. Update FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-TRACKER.md with Triggers System plan
2. Update MVP-SALES-READINESS-ASSESSMENT.md with new feature scope
3. Create comprehensive 3-week implementation plan
4. Design Triggers tab UI mockups

## 🤝 Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Feature Development Order (2025-01-16)
**Context:** Prioritizing next feature to implement
**Options Considered:**
1. Integration Marketplace (mock UI, 2 days)
2. Scheduling Engine (real feature, 2 weeks)
3. Database Connectors (real feature, 3-4 weeks)

**Decision:** Scheduling Engine first
**Rationale:**
- Non-breaking addition
- Leverages existing Prefect integration
- Makes current platform production-ready
- Clean UI additions

**Decision Owner:** User & Assistant consensus

---

### Decision 2: Expand Scheduling to Triggers System (2025-01-16)
**Context:** User requested "Run workflow after another workflow completes" capability
**Options Considered:**
1. Add to "Schedule" tab as additional option
2. Create separate "Triggers" tab supporting multiple trigger types

**Decision:** Create "Triggers" system with dedicated tab
**Rationale:**
- A workflow might need BOTH scheduled AND dependency triggers
- Future-proof for event-driven triggers (webhooks, file arrival)
- Clearer mental model: "What starts this workflow?"
- Matches industry patterns (Airflow triggers, Prefect automations)

**Trigger Types:**
- Manual (already exists)
- Time-based (scheduled) - NEW
- Dependency-based (after workflow) - NEW
- Event-driven (future)

**Decision Owner:** User & Assistant consensus

---

### Decision 3: Dependency Trigger Design Choices (2025-01-16)
**Context:** Defining behavior for dependency-based triggers

**Decision 3a: Multiple Triggers Per Workflow**
- **Decision:** YES - Support multiple triggers per workflow
- **Example:** Workflow can run daily at 2 AM AND after Customer Ingestion completes
- **Decision Owner:** User confirmed

**Decision 3b: Dependency Conditions**
- **Decision:** Support all three conditions initially
  - on_success: Run only if upstream succeeds (normal flow)
  - on_failure: Run only if upstream fails (cleanup/alerting workflows)
  - on_completion: Run regardless of status (audit trails)
- **Decision Owner:** User confirmed

**Decision 3c: Circular Dependency Prevention**
- **Decision:** PREVENT circular dependencies at trigger creation time
- **Rationale:** Industry standard (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster all block cycles)
- **Implementation:** Graph traversal algorithm to detect cycles
- **UX:** Show clear error with dependency chain visualization
- **Decision Owner:** Industry standard (user delegated decision)

**Decision 3d: Delay Support**
- **Decision:** Support 0-60 minute delay (default: 0 for immediate)
- **Rationale:** Industry standard (Airflow wait_for_downstream, Prefect wait_for)
- **Use Cases:** Eventual consistency windows, downstream system cool-down
- **Decision Owner:** Industry standard (user delegated decision)
