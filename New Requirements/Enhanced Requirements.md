- **ACID Transactions:** Support for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability across layers to ensure data integrity.[2][1]
- **Monitoring & Observability:** End-to-end data pipeline monitoring, automated anomaly detection, and alerting.[8][5]
- **Self-Service UI:** No-code or low-code interfaces for configuring ingestion, transformations, and metadata operations.[9][3]
- **Scalability & Modularity:** Support for horizontal scaling, modular pipeline configurations, and multi-cloud deployment.[8][1]

### Recommended Table of Core Features

| Layer   | Key Features (Sample)                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bronze  | Ingestion automation, metadata capture, historical retention        |
| Silver  | Cleansing, schema evolution, incremental loading, quality metrics   |
| Gold    | Aggregations, semantic tagging, security, AI/ML integration         |
| All     | Metadata catalog, transactions, monitoring, self-service UI         |

These features collectively ensure that the data product provides reliable, high-quality data transformation from raw ingestion to business-ready output, all powered by metadata and AI optimizations.[3][6][1][2][5]

At each layer of the medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), data storage formats and management practices should align with the requirements for fidelity, performance, and flexibility. The best recommended approach in modern cloud data lakes is to use **open columnar file formats** (like Parquet, ORC) with advanced table formats (such as Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg) to optimize for efficiency, schema evolution, and transactional integrity.[1][2][3]

### Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- **Storage format:** Data is typically stored in its native format, such as CSV, JSON, Avro, or raw Parquet, reflecting how it was received from source systems.[3][4][1]
- **Recommended approach:** Use open file formats (Parquet, Avro, ORC) to facilitate schema evolution, efficient queries, and interoperability, but keep the data as unmodified as possible for full traceability and lineage.[5][1]

### Silver Layer (Cleansed Data)
- **Storage format:** Data is converted to structured, columnar formats (Parquet, ORC) after cleansing, deduplication, and enrichment.[2][1][3]
- **Recommended approach:** Store data in Parquet or ORC format, managed with a metadata-driven table format like Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg to enable transactions, schema evolution, and partitioning for improved query performance.[1][2]

### Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- **Storage format:** Highly optimized structured formats, typically Parquet or ORC, partitioned and indexed for high performance. Data is organized into tables that are business-relevant and analytics-ready.[3][1]
- **Recommended approach:** Use a table format (Delta Lake, Iceberg) atop Parquet or ORC, enabling ACID transactions, versioning, and governance features for reliable reporting, analytics, and machine learning.[2][1][3]

### Table of Recommended Formats

| Layer   | Typical File Formats             | Best Table Formats/Features                |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Bronze  | Parquet, Avro, ORC, CSV, JSON    | Raw, schema on read, immutable             |
| Silver  | Parquet, ORC                     | Delta Lake, Iceberg (schema evolution, ACID)|
| Gold    | Parquet, ORC                     | Delta Lake, Iceberg (partitioning, indexing, ACID, versioning) |

**Key best practice:** Use columnar open formats (Parquet, ORC) at every layer, with advanced table formats (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg) to provide transactional safety, schema evolution, and rich metadata management—especially critical at Silver and Gold layers to enable analytics and business intelligence.[5][1][2][3]
