# Data & AI Accelerators Portfolio
## FY2026 Strategic Initiative

*Speridian Data & AI Practice*

---

## Executive Summary

We are proposing a portfolio of **four AI-powered Data Accelerators** that can be sold individually or as an integrated platform.

### Key Differentiators:
- **AI-first design** — Not bolted-on, built from ground up
- **Faster time-to-value** — Days/weeks, not months
- **Flexible deployment** — Standalone or integrated
