# UI Principles & Style Direction

## Principles
- Distinct, not derivative: Fresh visual language; no reuse of legacy layouts/colors.
- Clarity over clutter: Progressive disclosure with expert toggles.
- Information density: Compact tables and side panels with strong spacing rules.
- Accessibility: WCAG AA, keyboard‑first interactions, focus states, readable contrast.
- Observability: Runs and logs are first‑class citizens with quick drilldowns.

## Design Language
- Themes: Light and dark with a neutral base and a single vivid accent.
- Typography: Strong hierarchy (e.g., 12/14/16 base with mono for code/paths).
- Color: Semantic tokens for success/warn/error/info; charts friendly palette.
- Components: App shell, nav, data table, forms, code editor, graph canvas, chips/badges.

## Page Patterns
- Builder canvas + side panel; tabs for runs/config/schedule.
- Sticky table headers, column pinning, saved views and filters.
- Timeline for runs with metrics and inline error previews.
