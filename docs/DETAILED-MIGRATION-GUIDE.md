## Step 2: Backup Critical Files from Old Laptop

Before leaving your old laptop, you need to backup files that are NOT in git.

### 2.1 Backup Environment Variables

**Location:** `C:\Dev\FlowForge\apps\web\.env.local`

1. Open File Explorer on your old laptop
2. Navigate to: `C:\Dev\FlowForge\apps\web\`
3. Look for a file named `.env.local` (it might be hidden)
   - **To show hidden files:** View â†’ Show â†’ Hidden items
4. Copy this file to a USB drive or cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive)
5. **IMPORTANT:** This file contains API keys and secrets - keep it secure!

**If you don't have `.env.local`:** That's okay, you'll create a new one in Step 6.

---

### 2.2 Backup Database (Optional but Recommended)

**Location:** `C:\Dev\FlowForge\apps\web\data\flowforge.db`

1. Navigate to: `C:\Dev\FlowForge\apps\web\data\`
2. Copy the file `flowforge.db` to USB drive or cloud storage
3. This contains your workflows, data sources, and configurations

**If you want to start fresh:** Skip this step - a new database will be created automatically.

---

### 2.3 Verify GitHub Backup

On your old laptop, verify everything is pushed to GitHub:

```bash
cd C:\Dev\FlowForge
git status
```

**Expected output:** "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**If you see uncommitted changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: final backup before migration"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Clone Repository on New Laptop

### 3.1 Open Terminal/PowerShell

1. Press `Windows + X`
2. Select "Terminal" or "PowerShell"

---

### 3.2 Navigate to Desired Location

```bash
# Create Dev folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir C:\Dev
cd C:\Dev
```

**Note:** You can use any location you prefer, but this guide assumes `C:\Dev`

---

### 3.3 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeepvarmac/FlowForge.git
```

**Expected output:**
```
Cloning into 'FlowForge'...
remote: Enumerating objects: ...
remote: Counting objects: 100% ...
Receiving objects: 100% ...
Resolving deltas: 100% ...
```

---

### 3.4 Navigate into Project

```bash
cd FlowForge
```

---

### 3.5 Verify Clone Success

```bash
dir
```

**Expected output:** You should see folders like:
- `apps/`
- `docs/`
- `prefect-flows/`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `package.json` (if exists)
- etc.

---

## Step 4: Install Node.js Dependencies

### 4.1 Navigate to Web App

```bash
cd apps\web
```

---

### 4.2 Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

**This will take 5-10 minutes.** You'll see:
```
added 500+ packages in 5m
```

**Common issues:**
- If you see `ERESOLVE` warnings, that's normal - ignore them
- If you see errors about Python or node-gyp, ensure Python is in PATH

---

### 4.3 Verify Installation

```bash
dir node_modules
```

**Expected:** You should see hundreds of folders (dependencies)

---

### 4.4 Return to Root

```bash
cd ..\..
```

**Current location:** `C:\Dev\FlowForge`

---

## Step 5: Set Up Python Environment

### 5.1 Navigate to Prefect Flows

```bash
cd prefect-flows
```

---

### 5.2 Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**This creates a folder called `venv`**

---

### 5.3 Activate Virtual Environment

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Expected output:** Your prompt should now start with `(venv)`

Example:
```
(venv) C:\Dev\FlowForge\prefect-flows>
```

---

### 5.4 Update pip

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### 5.5 Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**This will take 5-10 minutes.** You'll see packages being installed.

---

### 5.6 Verify Installation

```bash
pip list
```

**Expected output:** List of installed packages including:
- prefect
- polars
- boto3
- psycopg2-binary
- etc.

---

### 5.7 Deactivate Virtual Environment

```bash
deactivate
```

**Expected:** The `(venv)` prefix should disappear from your prompt

---

### 5.8 Return to Root

```bash
cd ..
```

**Current location:** `C:\Dev\FlowForge`

---

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

### 6.1 Navigate to Web App

```bash
cd apps\web
```

---

### 6.2 Option A: Restore .env.local from Backup

**If you backed up `.env.local` from your old laptop:**

1. Copy the `.env.local` file from your USB/cloud storage
2. Paste it into: `C:\Dev\FlowForge\apps\web\`
3. Skip to Step 6.3

---

### 6.2 Option B: Create New .env.local

**If you're starting fresh:**

1. Copy the example file:
```bash
copy .env.example .env.local
```

2. Open `.env.local` in a text editor:
```bash
notepad .env.local
```

3. Update the following values:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration (if you use AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here

# Database Configuration (default - don't change unless needed)
DATABASE_PATH=./data/flowforge.db

# File Storage Configuration (default - don't change)
UPLOAD_DIR=./data/uploads
BRONZE_DIR=./data/bronze
SILVER_DIR=./data/silver
GOLD_DIR=./data/gold

# DuckDB Configuration (default - don't change)
DUCKDB_PATH=./data/analytics.duckdb

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. **Get OpenAI API Key (if needed):**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new secret key
   - Copy and paste it into `.env.local`

5. Save and close the file

---

### 6.3 Verify Environment File

```bash
type .env.local
```

**Expected output:** Your environment variables should be displayed

---

### 6.4 Return to Root

```bash
cd ..\..
```

**Current location:** `C:\Dev\FlowForge`

---

## Step 7: Set Up Docker Services

### 7.1 Ensure Docker Desktop is Running

1. Open Docker Desktop application
2. Wait until you see "Docker Desktop is running" in the system tray

---

### 7.2 Start Docker Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Expected output:**
```
[+] Running 3/3
 âœ” Container flowforge-postgres       Started
 âœ” Container flowforge-minio          Started
 âœ” Container flowforge-minio-client   Started
```

**This will take 2-3 minutes on first run** (downloading Docker images)

---

### 7.3 Verify Services are Running

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected output:**
```
NAME                    STATUS          PORTS
flowforge-minio         Up (healthy)    0.0.0.0:9000-9001->9000-9001/tcp
flowforge-postgres      Up (healthy)    0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
```

**All services should show "Up" or "Up (healthy)"**

---

### 7.4 Wait for Health Checks

```bash
# Wait 30 seconds for services to be fully ready
timeout /t 30
```

---

### 7.5 Test MinIO Access

1. Open browser
2. Go to: http://localhost:9001
3. Login with:
   - **Username:** minioadmin
   - **Password:** minioadmin123
4. You should see the MinIO Console

**If you can't access:** Wait another minute and try again

---

### 7.6 Verify MinIO Bucket

In the MinIO Console:
1. Click "Buckets" in the left menu
2. You should see a bucket named: `flowforge-data`

**If bucket doesn't exist:**
```bash
docker-compose restart minio-client
```

---

## Step 8: Restore Database

### 8.1 Create Data Directory

```bash
mkdir apps\web\data
```

**Note:** If it already exists, you'll see "A subdirectory or file already exists" - that's fine.

---

### 8.2 Option A: Restore Database from Backup

**If you backed up `flowforge.db` from your old laptop:**

1. Copy `flowforge.db` from your USB/cloud storage
2. Paste it into: `C:\Dev\FlowForge\apps\web\data\`
3. Skip to Step 9

---

### 8.2 Option B: Start with Fresh Database

**If you're starting fresh:**

The database will be created automatically when you first run the application in Step 9.

No action needed here - proceed to Step 9.

---

## Step 9: Start the Application
